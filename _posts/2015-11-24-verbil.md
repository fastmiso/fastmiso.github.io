title: Regarding Verbil
---

Due to contractual obligations in our work otherwise, Verbil is not currently under development. We removed it from App Store last summer, but then had requests to restore it, so we did. But we made it free because we cannot guarantee that we'll be able to update or support it.

Still, many, many people still use it every day--which thrills us!--and it has crashed for just one user in the last year. (Be a tiny bit careful when you input verses for automatic creation of vocabulary lists.) And no one has reported any bugs that we haven't fixed in v1.1.1.

You can [get it on the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/verbil-vergils-aeneid-reader/id757351337?mt=8), or [read more about it](/verbil/).
