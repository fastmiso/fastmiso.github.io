<center>Verbil aims to do one thing perfectly, to let you read and study Vergil's <em>Aeneid</em>. For fun, for college, or for the Latin AP exam.</center>

<br/>

__On Verbil's development status, see [this blog post](/2015-11-24-verbil/).__

<em>TL;DR: It is still [available on the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/verbil-vergils-aeneid-reader/id757351337?mt=8).</em>

## Clean, quiet reading

<img style="float: right;" src="/img/verbil-mini-text.png" hspace="10">

It's tough to beat a clean copy of Vergil's *Aeneid* and an armchair in a quiet corner of a library reading room. That&rsquo;s ideal.

In reality, however, we're probably more often at a desk surrounded by grammars, lexica, translations, notebooks, and flashcards.

With Verbil for iPad we seek to give you the ideal: all the tools you need to study effectively without compromising the simplicity and elegance of reading Vergil&rsquo;s Latin from a clean text in a quiet library.

<br/>

## Definitive definitions

<img style="float: left;" src="/img/verbil-mini-define.png" hspace="10">

<strong>Highlight any word to reveal its dictionary entry</strong>. Not a list of possible dictionary entries, but the correct dictionary entry for <em>this</em> word in <em>this</em> verse. 

Verbil&rsquo;s <em>Aeneid</em>-specific lexicon contains <strong>every word in the poem</strong>, including proper names. (That's a little over 5400 lemmata.)

<br/>

## Smart cards

<img style="float: right;" src="/img/verbil-mini-smart.png" hspace="10">

Verbil lets you create your own <strong>vocabulary sets</strong>, but it also maintains various <strong>smart sets</strong>: words you've starred, words you've looked up the most, words you've most often got wrong. 

Verbil even contains <strong>frequency sets</strong>, which oraganize all the words of the <em>Aeneid</em> by how often they appear in the poem. (Think Owen and Goodspeed&rsquo;s <em>Homeric Vocabularies</em>, but for the <em>Aeneid</em>.)

Verbil will even do something about which we&rsquo;re a bit conflicted: it will <strong>generate vocabulary sets for any range of verses you specify</strong>, even allowing you to exclude words based on their frequency. Want to create a set of the less common words in verses 1.1-200? It's (too) easy.

Oh, and you can <strong>share these sets with your friends</strong>, should you wish. They can read it as a text file or import it into Verbil on their own iPad.

<br/>

## Make it your own

<img style="float: left;" src="/img/verbil-mini-own.png" hspace="10">

Interlinear glosses and highlights are the worst. But what if you could <strong>show and hide those interlinear notes</strong>? Or simply <strong>flag a verse in the Alexandrian manner</strong>? Verbil seeks to give you all of the annotation tools you need to study the <em>Aeneid</em> without getting in the way of quiet, effective study.

We think you'll love reading the <em>Aeneid</em> using Verbil on your iPad so much that you&rsquo;ll have notes and annotations that you want to export. You can <strong>email your work or save it directly to your Dropbox</strong> account.

<br/>

## Where was I?

<img style="float: right;" src="/img/verbil-mini-dash.png" hspace="10">

When you launch Verbil, you'll see a <strong> dashboard presenting recent activity</strong>: what you've been reading, which verses you&rsquo;ve flagged, what words you&rsquo;ve been looking up, which vocabulary sets you&rsquo;ve studied recently, and much more. Click on a dashboard entry to pick up where you left off.

<br/>

## Word studies

<img style="float: left;" src="/img/verbil-mini-concord.png" width="120" height="120" hspace="10">

Do <strong>word searches</strong> based either on the lemma or an inflected form. See at a glance every instance of <em>arma</em> in the poem. Ever wonder where the word <em>semivir</em> occurs? Print, email, or save these studies to your Dropbox account.

<br/>

## Studying for the Latin AP Exam

<img style="float: right;" src="/img/verbil-mini-ap.png" hspace="10">

Verbil has several features to help you study for the Latin AP exam. Generate random passages from the assigned AP selections for reading practice. Flip through words you've had to look up most frequently. Share vocabulary sets with your classmates. Refer quickly to grammar handouts. Preparation has never been easier.

<br/>

## All you need for the <em>Aeneid</em>

### FAQ

These are some of the more frequent questions about Verbil. If you don't find an answer to your question here, feel free to [email us][1]. We're not that good at the Twitter.

#### Which edition of the *Aeneid* is Verbilâ€™s text based on?

The text was derived from the [Perseus Project][2]'s XML version of Greenough's 1900 edition but has a few corrections and orthographic modifications. At cruces, we sided with Mynors' 1969 OCT.

These works are licensed under the Creative Commons ShareAlike 3.0 license: [CC BY-SA 3.0 US][3]. For now, we've posted our text as JSON [here][4] (with a better solution forthcoming).

More importantly, do we accept emendations? Absolutely!

#### Do you plan to support other platforms and devices?

Maybe. Verbil began as a web app, turned into an iPhone app, and then shipped as an iPad app. It's not impossible that we ship the iPhone version at some point. There is currently no Android version.

#### How can I ensure that the iPhone version ships?

Rate Verbil for iPad in the App Store and tell your friends about it.


#### Are there hidden gestures within Verbil?

We hope you find all of the many gestures and features on your own, but the most definitive list is currently in [the v1.0 release notes][6].

# Release Notes

### **v1.1.1, 29 November 2014**

#### Fixes

*   Downright annihilated the possibility of blank flash cards appearing in the Recent Activity section. -- Various and sundry optimizations.

#### Notes

*   As ever, so much depends on a red wheelbarrow--and on App Store reviews! We refuse to interrupt your reading with one of those nagging "Please Rate Us In the App Store" dialogues, so we humbly ask here that you take a few minutes to leave a review in the App Store.

### **v1.1, 6 September 2014**

#### Changes

*   Despite our paedagogical leanings otherwise, we have made it easier than ever to look up a word in the text. Now, instead of highlighting a word and tapping 'Define', simply tap the word. -- A related change is that, when reading the text, you must now long-press (i.e., tap-and-hold) a verse to reveal the interlinear verse notes. -- It seems most people would prefer this. Please let us know if you find it too easy look up words.

#### Fixes

*   Say good-bye to the one crashing bug in v1.0.2, which just a couple saw when doing searches in the text view. -- You are now able to completely delete all text from an interlinear verse note in the text view. (Thanks, J.K.!) -- Long lines (e.g., v. 4.181) are no longer truncated. Tibicines are unaffected. (Thanks, A.L. and D.S.!) -- Faster, smoother scrolling of the text view, esp. on older devices. -- Updates for iOS 8 Compatability.

#### Notes

*   So much depends on a red wheelbarrow--and on App Store reviews! We refuse to interrupt your reading with one of those nagging "Please Rate Us In the App Store" dialogues, so we humbly ask here that you take a few minutes to leave a review in the App Store.

### **v1.0.2, 2 February 2014**

#### Fixes

*   Verbil no longer becomes so despondent if you ask it to create a passage in a book beyond the Vergilian Twelve. Until we can generate epyllia about Silvius Aeneas, Anna, and others, we'll show a warning instead of shutting down. -- Fixed a crash in the reader related to searching the text and dismissing the keyboard. Our sincerest apologies to those who ran into versions of this bug. -- Fix two bits of punctuation in Book 1. (Thanks, @telemachus!)

#### Notes

*   So much depends a red wheelbarrow--and on App Store reviews! We refuse to interrupt your reading with one of those nagging "Please Rate Us In the App Store" dialogues, so we humbly ask that you take time to leave a review in the App Store.
