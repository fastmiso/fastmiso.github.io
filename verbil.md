## Verbil FAQ

These are some of the more frequent questions about Verbil. If you don't find an answer to your question here, feel free to [email us][1]. We're not that good at the Twitter.

[toggle title='Which edition of the *Aeneid* is Verbilâ€™s text based on?' type='light'] The text was derived from the [Perseus Project][2]'s XML version of Greenough's 1900 edition but has a few corrections and orthographic modifications. At cruces, we sided with Mynors' 1969 OCT.

More importantly, do we accept emendations? Absolutely![/toggle]

[toggle title='Do you plan to support other platforms and devices?' type='light'] Maybe. Verbil began as a web app, turned into an iPhone app, and then shipped as an iPad app. It's not impossible that we ship the iPhone version at some point. There is currently no Android version.[/toggle]

[toggle title='How can I ensure that the iPhone version ships?' type='light'] Rate Verbil for iPad in the App Store and tell your friends about it. [/toggle]

[toggle title='Do you offer discounted volume purchases for schools?' type='light'] Absolutely. [Get in touch][5]. [/toggle]

[toggle title='Are there hidden gestures within Verbil?' type='light'] We hope you find all of the many gestures and features on your own, but the most definitive list is currently in [the v1.0 release notes][6].[/toggle]

## Release Notes


### **v1.1.1, 29 November 2014**

#### Fixes

-- Downright annihilated the possibility of blank flash cards appearing in the Recent Activity section. -- Various and sundry optimizations.

#### Notes

-- As ever, so much depends on a red wheelbarrow--and on App Store reviews! We refuse to interrupt your reading with one of those nagging "Please Rate Us In the App Store" dialogues, so we humbly ask here that you take a few minutes to leave a review in the App Store.

### **v1.1, 6 September 2014**

#### Changes

-- Despite our paedagogical leanings otherwise, we have made it easier than ever to look up a word in the text. Now, instead of highlighting a word and tapping 'Define', simply tap the word. -- A related change is that, when reading the text, you must now long-press (i.e., tap-and-hold) a verse to reveal the interlinear verse notes. -- It seems most people would prefer this. Please let us know if you find it too easy look up words.

#### Fixes

-- Say good-bye to the one crashing bug in v1.0.2, which just a couple saw when doing searches in the text view. -- You are now able to completely delete all text from an interlinear verse note in the text view. (Thanks, J.K.!) -- Long lines (e.g., v. 4.181) are no longer truncated. Tibicines are unaffected. (Thanks, A.L. and D.S.!) -- Faster, smoother scrolling of the text view, esp. on older devices. -- Updates for iOS 8 Compatability.

#### Notes

-- So much depends a red wheelbarrow--and on App Store reviews! We refuse to interrupt your reading with one of those nagging "Please Rate Us In the App Store" dialogues, so we humbly ask here that you take a few minutes to leave a review in the App Store.

### **v1.0.2, 2 February 2014**

#### Fixes

-- Verbil no longer becomes so despondent if you ask it to create a passage in a book beyond the Vergilian Twelve. Until we can generate epyllia about Silvius Aeneas, Anna, and others, we'll show a warning instead of shutting down. -- Fixed a crash in the reader related to searching the text and dismissing the keyboard. Our sincerest apologies to those who ran into versions of this bug. -- Fix two bits of punctuation in Book 1. (Thanks, @telemachus!)

#### Notes

-- So much depends a red wheelbarrow--and on App Store reviews! We refuse to interrupt your reading with one of those nagging "Please Rate Us In the App Store" dialogues, so we humbly ask that you take time to leave a review in the App Store.
